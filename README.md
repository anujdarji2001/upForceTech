## üîê Business Logic & Authorization Rules

### User Management
1. **Email Uniqueness**: Each email can only be registered once
2. **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
3. **Account Deletion**: When a user is deleted, all their posts and likes are automatically removed (cascade delete)

### Blog Posts
1. **Visibility Control**: Posts can be public (visible to all) or private (visible only to owner)
2. **Ownership**: Only post owners can update or delete their posts
3. **Content Validation**: Title and content cannot be empty
4. **Cascade Deletion**: When a post is deleted, all its likes are automatically removed

### Like System
1. **Unique Likes**: A user can only like a post once
2. **Visibility Rules**: Users can only like posts they can see (public posts or own private posts)
3. **Ownership**: Users can only unlike their own likes
4. **Cascade Cleanup**: Likes are automatically removed when posts or users are deleted

### Authentication & Authorization
1. **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
2. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 30 minutes (configurable)
3. **Protected Routes**: Most endpoints require valid authentication
4. **Owner-Only Operations**: Users can only modify their own content

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file

## üìÆ Postman Collection

### Importing the Collection
1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import" button
3. Select the `FastAPI CMS Collection.postman_collection.json` file
4. Import the environment file `Upforce.postman_environment.json`

### Environment Setup
The collection uses the following environment variables:
- `base_url`: API base URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `token_user1`: JWT token for User 1
- `token_user2`: JWT token for User 2
- `blog_id_user1`: Blog post ID for User 1's post
- `blog_id_user2`: Blog post ID for User 2's public post
- `blog_id_user2_private`: Blog post ID for User 2's private post


### Test Scenarios Covered
1. **User Management**
   - Registration with valid/invalid data
   - Login and token generation
   - Profile updates
   - Account deletion with cascade

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Invalid tokens
   - Missing authentication
   - Data validation errors
   - Pagination edge cases

### Collection Structure
The collection is organized in logical groups:
1. **Setup**: User creation and authentication
2. **Blog Operations**: CRUD operations for blog posts
3. **Like System**: Like/unlike functionality
4. **Authorization Tests**: Security and access control
5. **Edge Cases**: Error scenarios and validation
